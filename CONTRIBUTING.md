##Branches##
The repository contains a development and a master branch.
The master
branch should contain the last stable release. The development branch the
newest commit.
Everytime a new major release is created, the master branch should be copied
in extra branch. So we have access to all major releases.
When changing a former major release, a new development branch should be open.
